			Pointless Wars is an online single-player/multiplayer game I created senior year of high school
			for the Technology Student Association video game design competition. It would go on to win regionals,
			win 3rd in states out of 30+ teams, and qualify for finals. This was the first game I ever made using the
			Unity Game Engine, and was able to teach me how to make music, pixel art, and other assets for the Unity Engine.
			Additionally, this was the first app I ever published on the Apple App Store.
